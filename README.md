# Analysis-of-Electric-Vehicle-EV-Sales-by-State-in-India
This project aims to explore and analyze the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) across different states in India. The dataset contains state-wise EV registration data, which is cleaned, processed, and visualized to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. Through this analysis, we can identify which states are leading in EV adoption and how EV sales have evolved over time.
# Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis by State in India
