# Analysis-of-Electric-Vehicle-EV-Sales-by-State-in-India
This project aims to explore and analyze the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) across different states in India. The dataset contains state-wise EV registration data, which is cleaned, processed, and visualized to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. Through this analysis, we can identify which states are leading in EV adoption and how EV sales have evolved over time.
# Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis by State in India

## 📊 Project Overview
This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of electric vehicle (EV) sales across Indian states. With the growing push towards sustainable transportation, understanding regional trends in EV adoption helps policymakers, manufacturers, and stakeholders strategize better.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used includes:
- State-wise EV sales/registration data
- Time period (months/years)
- Total number of EVs sold

> 📌 Source: [Insert the dataset source if available, e.g., Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, Government of India]

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed
- Total EV sales by state
- Trend analysis over time
- Top states in EV adoption
- Comparative bar and line charts

## 🧪 Insights
- States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Delhi lead in EV adoption.
- Sales patterns vary significantly across states, likely due to differences in policies and infrastructure.

## ✅ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook `ELECTRIC VEHICLES SALES BY STATE IN INDIA.ipynb` in Jupyter

## 🔚 Conclusion
EV adoption in India shows promising growth. By identifying top-performing states and analyzing trends, we can gain actionable insights into how infrastructure and policy influence clean mobility.
